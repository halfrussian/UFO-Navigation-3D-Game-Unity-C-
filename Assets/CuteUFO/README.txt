============== v1.0 7/29/19 ==============
Thanks for download the Cute UFO!


The prefab are ready to use, and is located in the Assets/CuteUFO/Prefabs folder.
Just drag and drop it into the scene to use.

We have included an 'example' scene as well located at the Assets/CuteUFO/Scenes/example.unity. This scene showcases the various prefabs for easy review.

** Note, this pack is designed for the Lightweight render pipeline **

Be sure to have the LWRP enabled in your project to use this product.

The assets can still work with standard Unity or the HDRP, but you will need
to update the materials to use the proper shaders and textures. 


Thanks for checking out our asset!
